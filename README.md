Repository contains 1 folder name "backend", It contains 1 more folder for frontend name "frontEndDSP", it happened because github was not accepting the folder structure and at last i have to put that in backend folder.

In backend follow the steps
- npm i
- run --> npm start

In frontEndDSP follow the steps
- npm i 
- run --> ng serve
